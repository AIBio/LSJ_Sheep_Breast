# üêë Sheep Mammary Gland scRNA-seq Analysis

This repository contains the full R code and workflow for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of sheep mammary gland tissues. The analysis was performed using Seurat and multiple complementary downstream tools to uncover cellular composition, interactions, and biological functions at single-cell resolution.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The analysis is organized into the following parts:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Seurat Pipeline  
Basic preprocessing and quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization using the Seurat framework.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Immune Cluster Analysis  
Subclustering and annotation of immune-related cells, identification of marker genes, and functional enrichment.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Epithelial Cluster Analysis  
Refined analysis of epithelial subpopulations, including luminal and basal cell types, with emphasis on lineage hierarchy and function.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Final Annotation  
Comprehensive cell type annotation based on canonical markers, literature references, and cross-validation with multiple databases.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Trajectory Analysis  
Pseudotime and lineage trajectory inference to explore cellular differentiation dynamics using tools such as Monocle or Slingshot.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ CellChat Analysis  
Cell-cell communication inference using [CellChat](https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat), focusing on signaling pathway activities across cell types.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Integrative Analysis  
Integration of multiple samples or conditions using Seurat‚Äôs integration framework, identifying conserved and condition-specific features.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Metabolism Analysis  
Analysis of cell-type-specific metabolic signatures using curated gene sets and pathway enrichment tools such as GSVA or clusterProfiler.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Fibroblast Analysis  
Focused characterization of fibroblast populations, including subcluster identification and functional profiling.
